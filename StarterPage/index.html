<h2><font color="red">The Mythology Behind the Monster:</font></font></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong> Description:</strong> According to legend, Mothman is a black 10-foot creature with wings and red eyes. </li>
<li><strong>Date of First Sighting:</strong> November 15, 1966 </li>
<li><Strong>First Sighting:</Strong> Two young couples from Point Pleasant—Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette—told police they had seen a large white creature whose eyes "glowed red", standing at the side of the road near "the TNT area", the site of a former World War II munitions plant. Linda Scarberry described it as a "slender, muscular man" about seven feet tall with white wings, and said that she was unable to discern its face due to the hypnotic effect of its eyes. Distressed, the witnesses drove away at speed, and said that the creature flew after their car, making a screeching sound. It pursued them as far as Point Pleasant city limits. </li>
<li><strong>Skepticism:</strong> Wildlife biologist Robert L. Smith at West Virginia University told reporters that descriptions and sightings all fit the sandhill crane, a large American crane almost as tall as a man with a seven-foot wingspan featuring circles of reddish coloring around the eyes. The bird may have wandered out of its migration route, and therefore was unrecognized at first because it was not native to this region. </li>
